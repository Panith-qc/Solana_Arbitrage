# 🧪 PHASE 2 TESTING GUIDE

**Status:** Ready to test Phase 2 strategies  
**Risk Level:** Start with DRY-RUN mode  
**Capital Required:** 0.1-1 SOL for initial tests

---

## 📋 PRE-TESTING CHECKLIST

Before you begin testing Phase 2:

- [ ] ✅ Phase 2 merged to main (DONE)
- [ ] ✅ All Phase 2 files present in `/workspace/src/services/`
- [ ] ⚠️ System built successfully (`pnpm run build`)
- [ ] ⚠️ Development server can start (`pnpm run dev`)
- [ ] ⚠️ Private key wallet configured
- [ ] ⚠️ Test wallet with 0.1-1 SOL funded

---

## 🎯 PHASE 2 STRATEGIES TO TEST

### 1. **Backrun Service** ⚡
**File:** `src/services/backrunService.ts` (428 lines)

**What it does:**
- Monitors mempool for large swaps
- Executes trades AFTER price-impacting transactions
- Always returns to SOL (SOL → Token → SOL)

**How to test:**
```typescript
import { BackrunService } from './src/services/backrunService';

const backrun = new BackrunService();
await backrun.startMonitoring();

// Wait for opportunities (will log to console)
// Stop after testing: backrun.stopMonitoring();
```

**Expected Output:**
```
⚡ Backrun Service initialized
🎯 Strategy: SOL → Buy Token → Sell to SOL (ride price momentum)
🚀 Starting backrun monitoring...
💎 All backruns: SOL → Token → SOL
✅ Backrun monitoring active
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Service initializes without errors
- ✅ Monitors mempool for transactions
- ✅ Detects large swaps (>$100 USD)
- ✅ Calculates profit opportunities

---

### 2. **Cyclic Arbitrage Service** 🔄
**File:** `src/services/cyclicArbitrageService.ts` (439 lines)

**What it does:**
- Multi-hop arbitrage (3-5 hops)
- Always starts and ends with SOL
- Example: SOL → USDC → BONK → SOL

**How to test:**
```typescript
import { CyclicArbitrageService } from './src/services/cyclicArbitrageService';

const cyclic = new CyclicArbitrageService();
await cyclic.startScanning();

// Wait for cycles to be detected
// Stop after testing: cyclic.stopScanning();
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🔄 Cyclic Arbitrage Service initialized
🎯 Strategy: SOL → Token → Token → ... → SOL (always)
🚀 Starting cyclic arbitrage scanning...
💎 All cycles: SOL → ... → SOL
✅ Cyclic arbitrage scanner active
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Scans for 3-hop, 4-hop, 5-hop cycles
- ✅ All cycles start and end with SOL
- ✅ Profit calculations include gas fees
- ✅ Finds profitable routes (>0.001 SOL profit)

---

### 3. **JIT Liquidity Service** 💧
**File:** `src/services/jitLiquidityService.ts` (429 lines)

**What it does:**
- Adds liquidity right before large swaps
- Captures fees from the swap
- Removes liquidity immediately after
- All operations in SOL

**How to test:**
```typescript
import { JITLiquidityService } from './src/services/jitLiquidityService';

const jit = new JITLiquidityService();
await jit.startMonitoring();

// Wait for JIT opportunities
// Stop after testing: jit.stopMonitoring();
```

**Expected Output:**
```
💧 JIT Liquidity Service initialized
🎯 Strategy: SOL → Add Liquidity → Capture Fees → SOL
🚀 Starting JIT liquidity monitoring...
💎 Focus: SOL pairs only (SOL/USDC, SOL/BONK, etc.)
✅ JIT monitoring active for SOL pairs
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Detects large incoming swaps (>$1000)
- ✅ Calculates optimal liquidity amount
- ✅ Estimates fee capture vs impermanent loss
- ✅ Only targets SOL-based pairs

---

### 4. **Long-Tail Arbitrage Service** 🎯
**File:** `src/services/longTailArbitrageService.ts` (398 lines)

**What it does:**
- Arbitrage in less liquid, smaller tokens
- Lower competition, higher margins
- Integrates multiple DEXs

**How to test:**
```typescript
import { LongTailArbitrageService } from './src/services/longTailArbitrageService';

const longTail = new LongTailArbitrageService();
await longTail.startScanning();

// Wait for long-tail opportunities
// Stop after testing: longTail.stopScanning();
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🎯 Long-Tail Arbitrage Service initialized
🚀 Starting long-tail arbitrage scanning...
✅ Long-tail scanner active
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Scans less competitive token pairs
- ✅ Finds opportunities other bots miss
- ✅ Profit calculations include slippage
- ✅ Risk assessment per opportunity

## 🛠️ AUTOMATED TESTING SCRIPT

We've created a comprehensive test script for you!

### Run the Test Suite:

```bash
# Install tsx if not already installed
pnpm add -D tsx

# Run Phase 2 tests (dry-run mode)
npx tsx test-phase2.ts
```

### What the script tests:

1. ✅ **Mempool Monitor** - Checks transaction monitoring
2. ✅ **Priority Fee Optimizer** - Tests dynamic fee calculation
3. ✅ **Jito Bundle Service** - Verifies bundle creation
4. ✅ **Backrun Service** - Monitors for backrun opportunities
5. ✅ **Cyclic Arbitrage** - Scans for multi-hop cycles
6. ✅ **JIT Liquidity** - Detects JIT opportunities
7. ✅ **Long-Tail Arbitrage** - Finds long-tail opportunities

### Expected Test Duration:
- **1 minute** monitoring period
- Services initialize and scan for opportunities
- Results summary at the end

## 🎨 TESTING VIA DASHBOARD

### Step 1: Start Development Server
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open Dashboard
Navigate to: `http://localhost:8080`

### Step 3: Connect Wallet
- Use PrivateKeyTradingDashboard
- Enter your test wallet private key
- Verify balance shows correctly

### Step 4: Enable Phase 2 Strategies
In the dashboard settings:
- ✅ Enable "Backrun Trading"
- ✅ Enable "Cyclic Arbitrage"
- ✅ Enable "JIT Liquidity"
- ✅ Enable "Long-Tail Arbitrage"

### Step 5: Start MEV Scanner
Click "Start Scanner" button to activate all strategies

### Step 6: Monitor Opportunities
Watch the dashboard for:

## 📊 WHAT TO EXPECT

### During Testing (1-5 minutes):

**Good Signs:**
- ✅ Services initialize without errors
- ✅ Mempool transactions being detected
- ✅ Priority fees being calculated
- ✅ Opportunities being found (even if not profitable)
- ✅ Console logs showing activity

**Warning Signs:**
- ⚠️ No transactions detected (check RPC connection)
- ⚠️ Services failing to initialize (check imports)
- ⚠️ Errors in console (review error messages)
- ⚠️ No opportunities found after 5+ minutes (normal if market is quiet)

---

## 💰 LIVE TRADING PREPARATION

### Before Trading with Real Money:

1. **Dry-Run Success** ✅
   - All 7 services operational
   - No critical errors
   - Opportunities being detected

2. **Small Test Capital** ⚠️
   - Start with ONLY 0.1 SOL (~$24)
   - Test each strategy individually
   - Execute 1-2 trades per strategy

3. **Monitor First Trades** 📊
   - Watch execution closely
   - Verify profits match estimates
   - Check transaction confirmations

4. **Scale Gradually** 📈
   - 0.1 SOL → 0.5 SOL → 1 SOL → 5 SOL → 10 SOL
   - Increase only after successful trades
   - Stop if multiple losses occur

---

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Cannot find module"
**Solution:**
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

### Issue: "Service failed to initialize"
**Solution:**
- Check Helius RPC connection
- Verify private key is valid
- Ensure sufficient SOL for gas

### Issue: "No opportunities found"
**Solution:**
- Normal if market is quiet
- Try during high-volume hours (US/EU trading time)
- Lower minimum profit thresholds in config

### Issue: "Mempool not detecting transactions"
**Solution:**
- Check RPC endpoint is responsive
- Verify WebSocket connection
- Try different RPC provider if needed
