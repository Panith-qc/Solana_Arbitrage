# üöÄ DEPLOY YOUR FIXED BOT TO GCP

## ‚úÖ CRITICAL FIX APPLIED & PUSHED TO GITHUB

**GitHub Status:** ‚úÖ Pushed to `main` branch

## üéØ DEPLOY TO GCP (3 EASY STEPS)

### **Step 1: Set Your GCP Project ID**

```bash
export GCP_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id-here"
```

Replace `your-project-id-here` with your actual GCP project ID.

---

### **Step 2: Run Deployment Script**

```bash
./DEPLOY_FIXED_BOT_NOW.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. Builds the app with the fix
2. Deploys to GCP Cloud Run
3. Sets up auto-scaling
4. Returns your live URL

**Time:** 3-5 minutes

---

### **Step 3: Verify Deployment**

After deployment completes, you'll see:

```
‚úÖ DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE!
üîó Service URL: https://solana-mev-bot-xxxxx-uc.a.run.app
```

**Open that URL in your browser!**

## üìä WHAT TO EXPECT

### In the Console Logs:

**Before Fix:**
```
‚ùå FOUND OPPORTUNITY: JUP/SOL
   ‚Üí Tries SOL ‚Üí JUP first
   ‚Üí Loses $120!
```

**After Fix:**
```
‚úÖ CHECKING COMPLETE CYCLE: SOL ‚Üí JUP ‚Üí SOL
   Step 1: SOL ‚Üí Token (0.1 SOL)
   Step 2: Token ‚Üí SOL (got back 0.102 SOL)
   CYCLE PROFIT: 0.002 SOL ($0.38) ‚úÖ
```

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### "gcloud not found"

Install gcloud CLI:
```bash
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
exec -l $SHELL
gcloud init
```

### "Permission denied"

Authenticate:
```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

### "Port already in use"

The script uses port 8080 (Cloud Run default). If needed, modify `DEPLOY_FIXED_BOT_NOW.sh`:
```bash
--port 8080  # Express backend exposes 8080
```

---

## üìà MONITORING YOUR BOT

### View Live Logs:

```bash
gcloud run logs tail solana-mev-bot --region us-central1 --follow
```

### Check for Successful Cycles:

Look for:
- `CHECKING COMPLETE CYCLE` - Scanner is working
- `CYCLE PROFIT` - Found a profitable cycle
- `EXECUTING FULL ARBITRAGE CYCLE` - Executing trade
- `CYCLE COMPLETE` - Trade successful!

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

### Expected Behavior:

**You might see ZERO opportunities** - this is NORMAL!

**Why?**
- Real arbitrage cycles are RARE
- Markets are efficient
- Competition is high

**The difference:**
- **Before:** Found FAKE opportunities, lost money ‚ùå
- **After:** Finds ZERO opportunities, protects money ‚úÖ

### When Will It Trade?

Bot will execute when:
- Network activity is high
- Market volatility increases
- Large transactions create imbalances
- Real arbitrage appears

**Be patient!** Quality over quantity.
