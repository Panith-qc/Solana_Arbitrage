# Debug Questions - What Do You Actually See?

Is it:

# WHY I'M ASKING

I need to know if:
1. The NEW App.tsx deployed but has a bug (toggle button visible)
2. The OLD App.tsx is still cached somewhere (no toggle button)
3. There's a build error causing AutoTradingSetup to fail

Please answer these 5 questions so I can fix the RIGHT issue!
