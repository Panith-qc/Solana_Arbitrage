# ‚úÖ LOCAL TESTING CHECKLIST

**Status:** Starting local testing  
**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Mode:** Development server (safe testing)

---

## üéØ YOUR LOCAL TESTING SESSION

### Pre-Testing Setup ‚úÖ

**What you'll need:**
- [ ] Test wallet with 0.1-0.5 SOL (DO NOT use more!)
- [ ] Private key from that wallet (base58 string)
- [ ] Internet connection
- [ ] Browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)
- [ ] 15-30 minutes of time

---

## üìã STEP-BY-STEP TESTING GUIDE

### Step 1: Server is Starting üöÄ

The development server is starting now. You should see:
```
VITE v5.x.x  ready in xxx ms
‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:8080/
‚ûú  Network: http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8080/
```

**What to do:**
1. Wait for "ready" message in terminal
2. Look for the Local URL (usually http://localhost:8080)
3. Keep this terminal window open

---

### Step 2: Open Dashboard üåê

**Action:**
1. Open your browser
2. Navigate to: **http://localhost:8080**
3. You should see the PrivateKeyTradingDashboard

**What you should see:**
- Clean, modern UI
- "Connect Wallet" or "Enter Private Key" section
- Trading settings panel
- Empty opportunities list (normal, nothing running yet)

**Troubleshooting:**
- ‚ùå **Page doesn't load?** 
  - Check if dev server is running
  - Try http://127.0.0.1:8080 instead
  - Clear browser cache
  
- ‚ùå **Blank page?**
  - Check browser console (F12) for errors
  - Refresh page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)

---

### Step 3: Prepare Test Wallet üí∞

**Option A: Create New Test Wallet (Recommended)**
```bash
# In a new terminal:
solana-keygen new --outfile ~/test-trading-wallet.json

# Get the address:
solana-keygen pubkey ~/test-trading-wallet.json

# Fund with 0.1-0.5 SOL from your main wallet
# SEND TO ADDRESS SHOWN ABOVE

# Get private key (you'll need this for dashboard):
cat ~/test-trading-wallet.json
# This will show an array like [123,45,67,...]
# You need to convert this to base58 or use it as-is
```

**Option B: Use Existing Test Wallet**
- Export private key from Phantom/Solflare
- Make sure it has 0.1-0.5 SOL
- **NEVER use your main wallet!**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Only 0.1-0.5 SOL for testing!**

---

### Step 4: Connect Wallet üîê

**In the dashboard:**
1. Find the "Connect Wallet" or "Enter Private Key" section
2. Paste your private key (base58 string)
3. Click "Connect" or "Submit"

**What should happen:**
- ‚úÖ Connection successful message
- ‚úÖ Your SOL balance displays (should show your 0.1-0.5 SOL)
- ‚úÖ Wallet address shows (shortened format)
- ‚úÖ "Connected" status indicator

**Verify:**
- [ ] Balance is correct
- [ ] Address matches your wallet
- [ ] No error messages

**Troubleshooting:**
- ‚ùå **"Invalid private key"?**
  - Check format (should be base58 string)
  - Try regenerating from wallet
  
- ‚ùå **Balance shows 0?**
  - Wallet might not be funded yet
  - Check address on Solscan.io
  - Allow 30 seconds for RPC to sync

---

### Step 5: Configure Safe Settings ‚öôÔ∏è

**Find Trading Settings Panel (usually in sidebar or settings icon)**

**Set these SAFE values:**
```typescript
Minimum Profit: 0.001 USD      // Very low for testing
Maximum Position: 0.05 SOL     // Only 0.05 SOL per trade!
Auto-Trading: OFF              // Manual execution only
Slippage: 1.0%                 // 100 bps
Scan Interval: 5 seconds       // Slower scanning
Risk Level: LOW                // Conservative
```

**Enable these Phase 2 strategies:**
- ‚úÖ Backrun Trading
- ‚úÖ Cyclic Arbitrage  
- ‚úÖ JIT Liquidity
- ‚úÖ Long-Tail Arbitrage

**Keep disabled (for now):**
- ‚ùå Auto-Trading
- ‚ùå High Risk strategies

**Verify settings saved:**
- [ ] Settings panel shows your values
- [ ] Auto-trading is OFF
- [ ] Max position is 0.05 SOL or less

---

### Step 6: Start MEV Scanner üîç

**Find and click:**
- "Start Scanner" button
- or "Start MEV Engine" button
- or "Activate Strategies" button

**What should happen:**
1. Button changes to "Stop Scanner" or similar
2. Console logs start showing activity (open browser console with F12)
3. Status indicator shows "Scanning" or "Active"

**Console output you should see:**
```
üöÄ Starting MEV scanner...
‚ö° Backrun Service initialized
üîÑ Cyclic Arbitrage Service initialized
üíß JIT Liquidity Service initialized
üéØ Long-Tail Arbitrage Service initialized
üì° Mempool monitoring active
‚úÖ All Phase 2 services operational
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Scanner status is "Active" or "Running"
- [ ] Console shows initialization messages
- [ ] No red error messages
- [ ] Services list shows "operational"

---

### Step 7: Monitor for Opportunities üëÄ

**Wait 5-10 minutes and watch for:**

**What you'll see:**
- Opportunities appearing in the list
- Each opportunity shows:
  - Strategy type (Backrun, Cyclic, JIT, Long-Tail)
  - Token pair
  - Estimated profit (SOL and USD)
  - Risk level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
  - Execute button (if manual mode)

**Console activity:**
```
üìä Mempool transaction detected
üîç Analyzing opportunity...
‚ú® Opportunity found: Cyclic Arbitrage
   Path: SOL ‚Üí USDC ‚Üí BONK ‚Üí SOL
   Profit: 0.003 SOL ($0.72)
   Risk: LOW
```

**Expected results (10 minutes):**
- **Excellent:** 10+ opportunities found
- **Good:** 5-10 opportunities found
- **Fair:** 2-5 opportunities found
- **Low Activity:** 0-1 opportunities (market might be quiet)

**Troubleshooting:**
- ‚ùå **No opportunities after 10 minutes?**
  - Normal if market is quiet
  - Try during US/EU trading hours (9am-5pm EST)
  - Lower profit threshold to 0.0001 USD
  - Check console for errors
  
- ‚ùå **Lots of errors in console?**
  - Check RPC connection
  - Verify API keys are valid
  - Review error messages

---

### Step 8: Execute Test Trade (Optional) üí∏

**‚ö†Ô∏è ONLY if you're ready and confident!**

**Choose an opportunity:**
1. Look for LOW risk opportunities
2. Small profit is fine (even $0.10)
3. Simple strategies (Cyclic or Long-Tail)
4. Avoid HIGH risk for first trade

**Execute:**
1. Click "Execute" button on opportunity
2. Review details one more time
3. Confirm execution
4. Watch transaction progress

**What should happen:**
1. "Executing trade..." status
2. Transaction submitted to blockchain
3. Confirmation after 15-30 seconds
4. Balance updates
5. Profit/loss calculated
6. Transaction hash shown (copy this!)

**Verify on Solscan:**
```
Visit: https://solscan.io/tx/YOUR_TX_HASH
Check:
- Transaction confirmed
- Amounts match expectations
- No errors
```

**Track your trade:**
- [ ] Transaction hash: ___________________
- [ ] Strategy: ___________________
- [ ] Expected profit: ___________________
- [ ] Actual profit: ___________________
- [ ] Success: YES / NO
