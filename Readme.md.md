# Project Summary
The project is a high-speed trading system built on the Solana blockchain, designed to empower small investors to capitalize on real-time Miner Extractable Value (MEV) opportunities. It features an advanced MEV scanner, cross-DEX arbitrage capabilities, and machine learning-driven market analysis, enabling users to execute profitable trades while securely managing their private keys. Recent updates have optimized the trading configuration system and enhanced real-time market data services, ensuring a more efficient trading experience.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several key functional modules:
- **Trading Engine**: Executes trades using various strategies, including arbitrage and sandwich attacks.
- **Fast MEV Engine**: Optimized for rapid arbitrage execution with enhanced profit calculations.
- **AI/ML Capabilities**: Analyzes market trends and sentiment through predictive models.
- **User Interface**: Dynamic dashboards for real-time monitoring and trade management, including a comprehensive settings panel.
- **Risk Management**: Ensures secure trade execution with configurable limits and thresholds.
- **Wallet Management**: Integrates multiple Solana wallets for secure transactions.
- **Cross-DEX Arbitrage System**: Identifies profitable trading opportunities across decentralized exchanges.
- **Hybrid MEV Scanner**: Scans for genuine MEV opportunities using multiple data sources.
- **Advanced Sandwich Engine**: Implements multi-DEX arbitrage detection and various sandwich strategies.
- **Jito Bundle Manager**: Manages atomic sandwich execution and bundle submissions.
- **Competition Analyzer**: Analyzes competitor behavior to adapt strategies.
- **Capital Optimizer**: Manages smart capital allocation for limited budgets.
- **Integrated Scanner Button**: Activates all MEV services, optimizing performance based on user capital.
- **Real Trading System**: Connects to the Solana mainnet and Jupiter API for executing real trades.
- **Auto-Trade Settings**: Features an auto-trade toggle with customizable profit thresholds and position sizes.
- **Token Cleanup Service**: Scans wallets for stranded tokens and converts them back to SOL with adjustable recovery parameters.
- **Production Trading Dashboard**: Main trading interface with wallet integration, opportunity scanning, and trade execution.
